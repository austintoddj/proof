Proof is a simple REST API that [August Ash](https://www.augustash.com) uses to power a code challenge for prospective employees. During the interview process, we may ask developers to build a sample application that will consume the Proof API.

### Challenge Description

Employees at August Ash (AAI) are good-natured. We love to watch and share funny or creative videos with each other. AAI would like an application that allows employees to maintain a list of curated video links, view top ten lists, and to submit and rate linked videos.
